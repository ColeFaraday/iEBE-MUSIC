Introduction
************

Collective phenomena emerged from many-body Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
are studied by colliding ionized heavy nuclei at high energy, relativsitic
heavy-ion collisions. These collisions can create an extreme condition, under
which quarks and gluons are deformed from hadrons, the Quark-Gluon Plasma.
The dynamics during the relativistic heavy-ion collisions is extremly short.
During only a few yatoseconds, the collision system goes through a multi-stage
evolution. First, it evolves from a pre-equilibrium phase to a strongly
coupled fluid-dynamic regime. As the system further expands and cools, the
quarks and gluons will recombined into hadrons. These hadrons will scatter
with each other and eventually decoupled and fly freely to the detectors.
Because of this ultra-fast dynamics, we can not directly probe the QGP during
the collisions. Theoretical simulations are essential to rewind the final
measured particle momentum distribution to the early stage of the collisions.
The related phenomenological studies help us to study the properties of the
strongly-coupled QGP.

The iEBE-MUSIC package is a general framework to simulate the multi-stage
3D dynamics of relativistic heavy-ion collisions event-by-event.

This is a repository that stores all the scripts for running event-by-event relativistic heavy-ion simulations.
